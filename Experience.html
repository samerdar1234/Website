              <p><img src="self-taught.jpg" style="margin-top: 30px;" width="25%" /></p>

              <p>To ensure I was prepared for this internship, I was provided an overview of HTML, CSS, etc. I taught myself to use the requisite tools and created a reference website overnight.</p>

              <br>

              <h4 class="titles">Teaching Materials Design and Development</h4>

              <p>Before diving into the creation of tools to support the academic process, the other coding education interns and I reviewed existing Powerpoint decks from previous years as the rudimentary base for our teaching materials. Together, we diagramed the organizational flow of topics, topic relevance, ease in understanding, and completeness of logic within each slide.</p>

              <p>Through this diagramming exercise, we each identified many areas for improvement. My team then worked asynchronously to make changes to the slide deck but reconvened to reevaluate those individual improvements and determine the most effective organization to ensure a positive learning environment from both a teaching and student perspective. Pictured below are a few samples of the slide improvements.</p>
              &nbsp;

              <div class="sub">
                  <h5 class="titles">Slide Creation</h5>
                  <p>These first two images are of slides that were not included in the original slide deck, but I ideated and added with assistance from the other interns to add clarity. All students have different styles of learning, so each new slide was created to accommodate as many learning styles as possible.</p>
                  <img id="html_slide_img" src="html_slide1.PNG" />

                  <div id="html_slide">
                      <p>The slide shown to the left is now part of the HTML slide deck. In this presentation, we go over three concepts for the students which all sound similar but are very different. I suggested we add this slide to give a visual, singular representation of the differences between these three elements.</p>
                  </div>
                  <img id="css_slide_img" src="css_slide1.PNG" />

                  <div id="css_slide">
                      <p>The slide shown to the left is now part of the CSS slide deck. The original slide deck did not mention the box model at all so I worked with the other interns to create this new slide to give students the ability to layout their websites in an attractive, professional manner. As you can see, this slide was also created with an accommodating explanation and image. Below the slide is an example of the corresponding code along that was presented along with the prepared slide.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="blocked">
                      <h5 class="titles">Remodeling</h5>
                      <p>In addition to creating new slides for clarity, I also remodeled the original slides to be consistent with the accommodative layout the newer slides possess. For the majority of the changed slides, images needed to be added, and the information needed to be rewritten.</p>
                      <img class="slide_img" src="github_slides1.PNG" />
                  </div>
              </div>

              <p>Additionally, we created the academic program schedule, constructed assignments to re-enforce key skills, and researched new resources like cooler.co and typing.com to assist the students in basic skills and tools to help them develop their personal website development.</p>

                  <h3 class="titles">What I Learned</h3>

                  <p>There is always more to learn regardless of the field, however, through working with this program, I have improved upon my existing technical skills as well as soft skills. Below is a more detailed explanation of the skills I developed throughout this program.</p>
                  <img src="collaboration.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px; margin-right: 20px;" width="30%" />
                  <ul>
                  	<li><b>I furthered my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github through teaching it to others</b></li>
                  	<li><b>Communication: By juxtaposing this experience with previous technological mentorship roles I&#39;ve had, I discovered that regardless of the community, interest, and previous tech experience, if a person is given a set of expectations, they can learn and exceed those expectations if they are treated with respect and spoken to as a capable peer</b></li>
                  	<li><b>Collaboration: I had to work heavily with the other interns and instructors to develop the course. Then, throughout the course, the instructing team also had to constantly work together to present a cohesive, comprehensible program to the students. In addition to working with the instructing team, I also took on a leadership role within a team of students to produce an attractive, useful product for the small business website.</b></li>
                  	<li><b>Problem Solving: Within the program, the majority of my day-to-day operations was finding and fixing bugs in student code. Due to the challenges of teaching in a virtual environment, I had to constantly work with the other interns and the instructors to solve technological issues for the students. Many of the students used borrowed computers provided by JOURNi and had difficulty learning how to use the computers and share their screens to show us their code. I quickly learned how to talk the students through the steps of sharing their code, but if that failed, I had to adapt and be able to talk them through a problem based on their description.</b></li>
                  	<li><b>Time Management: I helped establish a schedule for the 6-week student program and adjusted the time frame based on student progress. </b></li>

        <p>I provided technical support for a class that focused on elementary programming concepts; a core requirement within the major. Students must successfully pass this class as a prerequisite for declaring a CS major. My work focused on three main areas:</p>

        <ul>
        	<li><b>Virtually reviewing class material with a group of 15-30 students in a discussion section.</b></li>
        	<li><b>One-on-one help with coding in both C++ and Python extended to help students &quot;debug&quot; /identify problems with the code, and correct the problem.</b></li>
        	<li><b>Tailored explanation of why the issue occurred to the student&#39;s understanding level. This was critical to reinforcing the information and ensuring a fundamental understanding and knowledge base. </b></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">

                <h3 class="titles">What I Learned</h3>
                <p>By working with students in a larger discussion group as well as on a
                more personal level, I have found that the students tend to have a different objective
                than the instructors for what the students should be getting from the course. The instructors
                want the students to learn and understand as much as possible and the students tend to also
                want to learn but ultimately want to perform well in the class. As a teaching assistant,
                I learned how to balance those objectives so each student would get a combination of
                thoroughly learning the material and learning ways to approach problems they may
                see on an exam.</p>
                <p>I also learned how to more effectively translate a technical problem into a
                nonntechnical explanation to suit students of all skill levels. </p>
